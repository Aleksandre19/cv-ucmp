# Doctor Diana-Voronina-Akhvlediani's website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my mother's website about lossing of weight. Because the lossing weight does't only mean to eat less, she use individual approach for discovering of real reasons which caouses hight weight. The reasons can be sometimes emotional or psychological.

## Demo

## UX

### User stories

The user of this website should understand what is site about, what are keys of this medhod and way it is special. 


### Strategy
My goal in the design was to catch user's attantion straight in the first look with some pleasant effect and then expanding and showing key features and specification of the this method.  


### Scope
Firt of all for users of this website i wanted to create some pleasant animation with hight quality images and some really eye caching text animiation to give them understanding: what is website about, what can they have and author's personality. Then continue chronologically expanding and explaining information by easylly moving from one section to another section. And finally finishing the page with section of free consultation.    

### Structure
To achieve my goals i choosed landing page. First section was for eye catching animation. Second section i used to expand information about method and how can it be done. Third section i used to show  by whom can it be done. Forth section i used to show author's experience by providing them videos. Fifth section i used for feedbacks and finally in the end of the page when users probably should have the aroused interest i provided ability to get more information by free consultation's form.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)


## Features
This site uses loading icon while it loads. I use scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. On the mobile divices the navbar is collapsed and it expands on tablets and above. The menu's links uses Hover.css effect to move up on hovering. I use Bootstrap's Scrollspy feature to mark menu's link when user is on appropriate section. The site uses Bootstrap's Modal to pop up the singup form by clicking on Sign Up button in first section. In the first section i use SVG file for WEIGHT & HEALTH text to animate strokes of this text with CSS3 in sequence. 

### Features Left to Implement
In the future i would like to: add sublinks to video's link to categorise and expand video's section, add blog section, write animation's script in Javsscript/Jquery, take good quality Diana's photo and make adjustment in Photoshop, make to work registration's section, improve video section's look 

### Individual approach's section
