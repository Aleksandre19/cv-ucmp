# Doctor Diana-Voronina-Akhvlediani's website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my mother's website about lossing of weight and health. Because the lossing of weight does't only mean to eat less, she use individual approach for discovering of real reasons which caouses of hight weight. The reasons can be sometimes emotional or psychological.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://aleksandre19.github.io/User-Centric-Frontend-Development-Mileston-Project/).

## UX

### User stories

The user of this website should understand what is the site about, what are keys of this medhod and way it is special. 

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to catch user's attantion straight in the first look with some pleasant effect and then expanding and showing sequently the key features and specification of the this method.  


### Scope
Firt of all for users of this website i wanted to create some pleasant animation with hight quality images and some really eye caching text animiation to give them understanding: what is website about, what can they get and give a message about author's personality. Then continue sequently expanding and explaining information by smoothly moving from one section to another section. And finally finishing the page with section of free consultation.    

### Structure
To achieve my goals i choosed landing page style. First section is for eye catching animation. Second section i use to expand information about method and how can it be done. Third section i use to show  by whom can it be done. Forth section i use to show author's experience by providing her's videos. Fifth section i used for feedbacks and finally in the end of the page when users probably should have the aroused interest i provided ability to get more information by free consultation's opportunity.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. On the mobile divices the navbar is collapsed and it expands on tablets and desktop devices. The menu's links uses Hover.css effect to move up on hovering. I use Bootstrap's Scrollspy feature to mark menu's link when user is on appropriate section by changing color and making underline. The site uses Bootstrap's Modal to pop up the singup form by clicking on Sign Up button in the first, animation's section. In the first section i use SVG file for WEIGHT & HEALTH's text to sequently animate strokes of this text with CSS3.


### Features Left to Implement
In the future i would like to: add sublinks to video's link to categorise and expand video's section, add blog section, write animation's script in Javsscript/Jquery, take good quality Diana's photo and make adjustment in Photoshop, make to work registration's section, improve video section's look, animate modal's pop up window with Javascript/Jquery. 


### Individual approach's section
In the beginning of this section user finds text which describes point of view of the health and it's connection to the weight. Then comes section’s title with icon which hides on the tablets and mobile devices. After the title comes three steps of finding reason each one by their's own icon. They are: gathering information, separation of pathologies and doing of research. On the mobile devices they are located vertically.  On tablets and desktop devices those steps sections are located side by side.  The style of the steps changes depending on the device where it is viewed. On IPod Pro and desktop devices each steps’s title has background style with it’s own color and also left side in the each step’s container has vertically right forwarded shadow. Section’s background image changes in sizes depending on the device. On the desktop devices with resolution in the width more than 1300px the section’s max-width is 1300px and margins to the left and right are auto. So it becomes centered.
