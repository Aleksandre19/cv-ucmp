There appears also one vertical line under the middle of the images which starts from the top images and ends with last one.  The number of the quotes increases by one on tablets and desktop devices. This section has background image which size changes accordingly to the devices. On the mobile and tablet devices it has background-attachment : scroll; and it changes to the background- attachment:  fixed; on the desktop devices. ","","### Consultation’s section","","This section starts with question and one paragraph text.  Then comes registration form with three inputs tags and one submit button. First and second are text type tags and they have required attribute. Third one is for email and if a user doesn’t enter a email it alerts to use email format for this input. The email input tag has required attribute. The form tag has two attributes: action and method. First one has value # and decent one has the value POST. This section has background image which’s size and style changes deppending on devices it was viewed.  On the iPod Pro and desktop devices I use two div tags with CSS property position: absolute and z-index: 1 to set and adjust left and right background images.","","","### Footer","","The footer consists with three columns. The right one is a column for section’s links including the ones which are not in main menu. They are: Individual approach and feedback’s sections. The links changes a colours as same as other links in the footer by hovering over them . The change is done by CC3’s transitions property. Each column on the mobile devices except for the first one have top border which disappears on the tablets and desktops devices.  Second column is for social links and third column is for videos links. To achieve something like a content balance in the footer the social links and the videos links  swaps the places on the tablets and desktop devices. Which is done by bootstrap’s class: d-none and d-md-block. In the very end of the footer there is copyright text.","","","## Section's summery ",""," On the desktop devices with resolution in the width more than 1300px all sections except animation’s section has  max-width: 1300px and margins to the left and right - auto. So it becomes centered."," ","With this consistent layout of the sections i think i achieved my goal which was to catch user's attantion and then distribute sequently theirs attantions over the content.","","# Testing","","If you try to submit the registration form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name, and ‘last name’ fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. If a user  is interested in registering me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.","","All video links will open in a new tab using 'target=\"_blank”.  All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.","","By clicking on the links in the navbar, the scrollSpy effect will work regardless of whether or not you're viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar.","","This site was tested all modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on some mobile devices (iPhone 6: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that background-attachment: fixed was not compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photos appeared zoomed-in and blurry. To fix this, the background-attachment: scroll property value was added in a media query. ","","  I found also that registration form had you margin problem on mobile and it was fixed by media query in style.css file. ","","  In the about me section on the mobile the text’s hight was more than section and was overlapping the section under it. It was fixed also with media query.","","  In the Safari browser there was about me link’s problem in top menu. It was breaking. It was fixed by CSS property white-space: nowrap; ","  ","   There is SVG file problems which I could’t fixe because I did not have time and knowledge to do it.
